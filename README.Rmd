# chradle

A simple test harness for Chromium/Chrome, drive-able from R using a websocket connection.
It started out as an R6 class but all the asyc/promise craziness got to be too
hard in that context, so now it's just a library of functions.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("milesmcbain/chradle")
```

## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(chradle)
library(magrittr)

test_session <-
  chr_init(url = "http://localhost:8080",
           debug_port = 9222,
           bin = "chromium-browser",
           block_on_message_pattern = "r2vr-message-router",
           incomming_debug = TRUE)

session_state <-
  chr_call(test_session, get_attributes(id = "block",
                                        attribute = "material"))
session_state
chr_kill(test_session)
chr_clean()

```
